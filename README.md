## How it's made
HTML, CSS, JS

I used the FETCH API to get the link of the NASA picture of the day API. I grabbed the key/values I wanted to display on the DOM, photo name, description, and media- including images and videos. I used a conditional statement to toggle the image or video on or off depending on the media type of that particular day.

## Lessons learned
This was the first time I used iFrame. In order to make the element visible to the human eye, I removed its border; however there is still space on the page. In order to make a fairly simple page fun, I used CSS to make it interative.
