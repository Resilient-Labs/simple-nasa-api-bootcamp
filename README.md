# ðŸš€ Project: Simple NASA API

### Goal: Enable your user to enter a date and return the picture/video of the day from NASA's API
This project was a project utilizing NASA's API were it grabs the users input of date & displays a image taken that day.

## How it's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, Javascript

## Optimizations
I'd like to go back and redo this site using Flex

## Lessons Learned
This site was a great learning experience to make API's connect. It was cool to see you make an input & get an image back, i tried my birthday of course. But making information from the API display was also a very good lesson & manipulating it to recieve something else such as time.

## Example
Take a look at these example that i have below:
