## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NASA API

## Lessons Learned:
No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
