### How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This NASA app uses 1 API (nasa.gov) to return the 'picture of the day' for a selected day. The user inputs a date and clicks enter or the button. Then, the NASA picture and its description for that date is returned to the DOM. It is made using an input, event listener, function, and fetch statement. 


### Lesson Learned

I learned how to fetch data from an API. In this case, the API url needs a date parameter to fetch the picture/video of the day. The date is retrieved from the input and inserted into the url through a template literal.
