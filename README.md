# NASA Picture Of the Day
This was my first time using an API. The objective was to have the user be able to enter a date and then get in return an image + some other piece of information from the nasa APOD API.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Javascript

Really just used some basic HTML & CSS along with the ES6 I used after fetching the data from NASA.

## Optimizations
There's not much left to optimize. Currently, the image loading happens pretty slowly and with no transition, two things I could probably change. The styling isn't bad but can certainly also use some work.

## Lessons Learned:

This was my first time using APIs so I learned a lot, mainly about how fetching from an API link works and what's needed to use the information that's returned.
