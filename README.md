# My NASA Project
In this project I called an API for NASA's picture of the day & it displays the discription for the picture.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice

In this project I created a website that pulls Nasa's API for picture of the day. I used css to center the information displayed. I not only displayed the picture of the day, but also the discription for the pictures. When the user enters a date: Year-Month-Day and press 'submit' the page grabs the information from the API.


## Lessons Learned:

In this project I learned how to properly select a element in the html and change what it displays with document.querySelector('img').src = response.hdurl.
