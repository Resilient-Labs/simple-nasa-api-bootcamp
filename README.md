<b>Tech Used</b>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON

<b>What I Learned:</b> This was the first API that I worked on with my peers. It was the first time I saw anything related to JSON and was initially intimidated. The more I became comfortable with the syntax, the easier the task was for me. A challenge I faced in this project was toggling the img if it was a photo and toggling iframe if it was a video. With the help of my group I was able to figure it out.
