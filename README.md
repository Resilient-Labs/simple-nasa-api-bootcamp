## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6+

## Optimizations:

* Add styling to the site
* Let people see data from multiple days at once

## Lessons learned:

I learned how to use input values, specifically a date, to retrieve different sets of data from the NASA API. Since YYYY-MM-DD format is not common, I used a date picker in HTML to make it easier for users to select. I learned how to create an API key in order to access it.
