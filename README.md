How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This app requires the user to input a date which is sent into the api. The api then grabs that date in their fata and sends back the data of an mage or video with a short explanation of  the photo.

Lessons Learned:
I was confused on how to only show only the video if their was a video at first. Realized it was a lot easier than expected haha.
