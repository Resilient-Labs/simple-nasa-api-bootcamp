## Design and Development:
**Tech Used** HTML, CSS, JavaScript: 
Users are able to select a date and retrieve photos or videos from NASA's API. 

## Lessons Learned:
Learned to be mindful about APIs that return different media types to be able to display them properly in the DOM. I wasn't able to clear videos if next date submitted returns an image and vice versa so page refresh is required.

## API Source:
**NASA:** https://api.nasa.gov/#live_example
