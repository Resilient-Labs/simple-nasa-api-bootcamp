# Simple NASA API ðŸš€

<a href="https://kellychhe-simple-nasa-api.netlify.app/">This is a website</a> using NASA's photo of the day API that prompts the user to put in a date (before today) to see NASA's photo/video of that day with title, credit, and description.

## Languages Used 

This was created using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

This is my first go at using an API to build a website. I used the date that the user enters as a query parameter. I selected heading tags, paragraph tag and the img/iframe tags to display the title, description, and image on the DOM. Space is awesome so that made this project fun!

## Lessons Learned

With this project I was able to learn the difference between using image and iframe tags. I'm glad this was the first API I worked with because the documentation was easy to understand and the API itself did not too much information to sort through. All in all a good experience :)
