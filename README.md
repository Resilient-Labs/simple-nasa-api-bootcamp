### How It's Made:
  Tech used: Html, CSS, JavaScript
  To create this I first visited nasa's website to access an API that allowed me to see the picture of the day. I then fetched that API within javaScript. After I fetched the API and checked to see if it worked I took a look inside the Object and took out any information that I needed. I then created varibles to access that infomation and display it on my layout.
  
  ### Lessons Learned:
  
  With this project I learned how to fetch a APi and use a API key properly.
