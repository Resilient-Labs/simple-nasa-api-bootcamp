# ðŸš€ Project: Simple NASA API

### Goal: Enable your user to enter a date and return the picture/video of the day from NASA's API

<ol>
  <li>The HTML and CSS was simple enough; classic &lt;input&gt; to allow Javascript to add the user input, only I set the type to data <em>because I would rather not have to code extra JavaScript to disallow user goofs if I do not have to</em>.  Clickable &lt;button&gt; to start that bad boy up.</li>
  <li>The CSS was given a simple layout, flex on flex on flex, baby.  The main focus was getting images to show when images were the data type versus videos. <emThere are a couple of dates that show images and not videos</em></li>
  <li>The JavaScript behavior, however, was API-based.  This is a concept I did not fully understand <em>until I started really walking through how to grab data types.</em></li>
  <li>Using a conditionals to add classes 'hidden' and 'hiddenFlexImg', I was able to toggle the visibility of user date inputs with the data type 'image' over the data type 'video' and vice versa.</li>
  <li>The other data types cooperated just fine, <em>thankfully.</em></li>
  <li>Each data type falls into its document.querySelector (h2, h3, img, etc.) respectively.</li>
  <li>And that's it, done and dusted.</li>
</ol>

<p>Overall, I like it. It was simple once I broke it down in layman's terms.  I get it--grab this from this directory and then plug it into this spot in my HTML.  Now, to figure out how make it a little more complex, but that will come in time.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I completed the challenge: | 5 <em>It's simple--the design and the concept, so nothing crazy.</em></li>
  <li>I feel good about my code: | 4 <em>API's are too bad to understand, it's grabbing the data type you need, I'm seeing.</em></li>
</ul>
