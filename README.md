## Tech Used:
- Fetches from NASA's API
- Javascript, HTML, CSS

### Things I'm proud of:
- Had trouble at first when fetching from the endpoint and recieved data that wasn't an image file. Learned to use inspect and the console to figure out the exact object prop I needed to call
- Was able to incorporate conditionals that would handle rendering a photo versus video in an organized manner in the brwoser
- Was able to add my own creative touch to the UI/UX design
