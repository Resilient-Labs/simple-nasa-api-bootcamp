### Tech Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Lessons Learned
- Use of `<iframe>` to embed another HTML page into the current one, allowing videos from NASA to display directly on our page.
- Restriction of date inputs to the current date and the earliest accessible date.
- Design of a shooting star animation in CSS.
- Use of the `change` event, which triggers updates when the user modifies an element's value, enhancing user experience. For this project, I used it in lieu of a submit button to dynamically fetch new picture/video content on date changes.
