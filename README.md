# Nasa API
A NASA database is an extremely exciting database to experiment with. The user inputs a date and you receive an image as well as a video that NASA used for that sday.

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, & JavaScript

## Lessons Learned:

Using a conditional to make a video and image appear was easily envisioned but I did not use a template literal initially. After writing and debugging I finally came to that conclusion. It worked!
