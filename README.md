# My To do list
This project is a simple NASA API. I was able to utilize a date to request for an image/video from the date that the user inputs, so when you input a date(YYYY-MMM-DD) it will give you the image or video from the date that you've searched for.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I created a simple API design for this NASA API with an input and a button. I used CSS to margin the input and button to center them. Next I centered the image/video and lastly I used JavaScript to create the behavior with the button and the input to request for the image/video from the date that is being searched for, and finally fetches the image/video from the API.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that you can use the iFrame tag to request for videos from the embeded code on any video.
I learned that you can hardcode the input variable into the API url to request for anything you input into the search bar(input).
