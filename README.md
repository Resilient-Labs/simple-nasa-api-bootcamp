### How It's Made:
I used HTML and CSS to give the website structure and style. I also used the framework flexbox for positioning the elements on the page.

### Functionality: 
For functionality I used JavaScript and integrated NASA's photo/video of the day so that when the user enters a date the photo or video of the day will appear on the page.
