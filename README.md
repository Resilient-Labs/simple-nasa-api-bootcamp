## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, API

Users can enter enter a date and return the picture/video of the day from NASA's API. I focused on retrieving the picture of the day and some other information from the API. 

<!-- ## Optimizations

An array could be used as we learned more about those and objects. Will be looking to add and optimize this code in the future. -->

## Reflections:

This was an introductorary to using API's and fetching data from them. This was a great way to try a simple API's out!
