# How it was made:
#### HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, API, JSON,

# Optimizations:
#### Javascript functions controlling the display properties of the image and iframe elements were included to help keep the display clean.

# Lesson Learned:
#### Making the Javascript more Object Oriented made it easier to keep track of values and scope when calling calling and manipulating those values through methods. This allowed manipulating the DOM much easier and made the code easier to read.
