# Simple NASA API App
This is a small app that returns the picture of the day from NASA's website when a date is entered in. It utilizes NASA's API.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API

I made this by finding NASA's API link and adding an API key to it to access it and it's specific parameters to get the picture of the day. I tested it on Postman to check if it was working and it was; it then returned the JSON for the API. I started to build a function that would fetch the API and return it's reponse. By using console.log on the response I was able to see which values I would need to incorporate in the function to get the function to run on the DOM as well.


## Lessons Learned:

THrough building this project, I learned how APIs work. I learned about JSON and how JSON is basically a giant array that holds a bunch of objects with key-value pairs you can access using a combination of dot notation or optional brackets to select which index you need from the JSON array. I learn how to append newly created elements with the appendChild method to add to the DOM to make new elements appear in my HTML.
