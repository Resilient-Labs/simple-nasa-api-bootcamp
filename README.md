# Nasa API

Users are able to enter in a date in time, and receive a picture of space on that date! Pretty neat.

## How It's Made:

Languages/frameworks use: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Thoughts:

Actually, I think this was the first API project we worked on, not the weather. It was considerably easier than the rest because we had a working API for it, and everyone was working on the same thing. We just had to figure out what parameters to target, and how to make them show it. First time working with API keys too! This sort of became the template for the rest of the projects that we needed to work on.
