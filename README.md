# ðŸŽ° Week08 Bootcamp2021 Project: Simple NASA API Project

### Goal: Build a Simple Nasa API

This is my simple NASA API project! Users can enter in a numerical date value by year, month, and day  (Ex: 1997-04-02) and the application will fetch the image or video of the day and its description for that specific date.
