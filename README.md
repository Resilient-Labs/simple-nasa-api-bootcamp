# Simple NasaAPI

### What I did to build this app:
Here is my code that fetches a NASA API that generates an image based on the date. The image is accompanied by a name and description. There is also the rare chance that the media form might be a video and not an image!
I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to code this project as well as a public API provided by NASA.

### Lessons Learned :

The main part of this project focused on pulling data from the object provided by NASA's API. The images were somewhat easy to figure out. However, rarely, there was a date in the database/API that provided a video instead of an image. At first I had some trouble dictating how to clarify the difference in my code to have a static image present itself vs. be able to play a video when a video popped up on my screen. I also had trouble at first alternating between the image and video if one popped up after a click of the button in my project. Eventually I decided to implement a .hidden class to hide and toggle off the class to present the image or video
